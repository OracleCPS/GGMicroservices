## Replicating into Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse(ADWC) with Heterogeneous database
## Introduction

In this lab, you will take a look at how to set up replication from MySQL DB to Oracle Autonomous Data warehouse(ADWC) using Classic Goldengate for MySQL and Goldengate Microservices architecture.

This lab supports the following use cases:

- Setting up GoldenGate for MySQL.
- Setting up Replication in GoldenGate Microservices architecture for Oracle ADW (OGGMSALABX.* , where X is your participant ID assigned at the beging of the workshop).

## Objectives

Create a classic GoldenGate architecture capture process (Extract) for MySQL and a Microservices delivery process (non-Integrated Replicat) to receive the data to Oracle Autonomous Datawarehouse.  While MySQL isn’t supported as a deployment option for Microservices yet, you can still connect classic GoldenGate instances for MySQL to Microservices GoldenGate instances to replicate data.

**Please Note: Lab 1 and Lab2 are pre-requsite to complete for this Lab**


## Required Artifacts

### **STEP 1**: Create Replication Environment
This step sets up a clean GoldenGate Microservices source and target configuration.  This script will take a couple of minutes to complete.

- Open up a terminal window and change directory to Lab91 and run the script **build_all.sh**.
              
              [oracle@OGG181DB183 ~]$ cd ~/OGG181_WHKSHP/Lab91/
              [oracle@OGG181DB183 Lab91]$ ./build_all.sh 
             
- Make sure the target Schema is clear , run the command "reset_ADWC.sh **X**". Where X is your participant ID that was assigned during Lab. If the participant number was 1 then enter the following 

              [oracle@OGG181DB183 Lab91]$ cd /home/oracle/OGG181_WHKSHP/Lab91/Reset/db/
              [oracle@OGG181DB183 db]$ ./reset_ADWC.sh 1

- This script performs the following:

                1.	Deletes any existing deployments, which will remove any current lab setups.

                2.	Creates the target deployments for this lab (SanFran).

                3.	Creates new credentials for the deployment.

                4.	Adds checkpoint table for the database. 

### **STEP 2**: MySQL Setup

GoldenGate for MySQL is already installed on the Ravello image.  You will be using another terminal session to run the MySQL transactions and GoldenGate processes

- Open a new Terminal window from the VNC Console.

- Sudo into the root user and when Prompted use the password 'Welcome1'

       oracle@OGG181DB183 ~]$ sudo su - root
      [sudo] password for oracle: 
      Last login: Thu Feb 14 18:10:24 UTC 2019 on pts/1
      Last failed login: Thu Feb 14 18:12:02 UTC 2019 from 73.163.148.213 on ssh:notty
      There were 6 failed login attempts since the last successful login. 
      
- Change to the MySQL GG home.
      
      [root@OGG181DB183 ~]# cd /opt/app/oracle/product/18.1.0_GGMySQL
    
- Run the GoldenGate command interpreter (GGSCI).

      [root@OGG181DB183 18.1.0_GGMySQL]# ./ggsci

      Oracle GoldenGate Command Interpreter for MySQL
      Version 18.1.0.0.0 OGGCORE_18.1.0.0.0_PLATFORMS_180928.0432

- Start the manager and check with info all command

      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 1> start mgr
      Manager started.


      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 2> info all

      MANAGER     RUNNING                                           


- Run the OGG obey script to create the replication processes and check with info all command
       
       GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 3> obey ./dirprm/setup_mysql.oby
Output will as below :         

      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 3> obey ./dirprm/setup_mysql.oby

      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 4> -- This is a script(oby) file that executes GGSCI commands to initialize the GoldenGate environment. These commands can be run individually directly via the GGSCI interface.

      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 5>

      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 7> ADD EXTRACT E_MYSQL, VAM, BEGIN NOW

      EXTRACT added.

      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 8> ADD EXTTRAIL ./dirdat/eo, EXTRACT E_MYSQL, MEGABYTES 50

      EXTTRAIL added.

      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 9> 

      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 9> ADD EXTRACT P_ORA18C, EXTTRAILSOURCE ./dirdat/eo

      EXTRACT added.


      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 10> 

      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 10> ADD RMTTRAIL rt, EXTRACT P_ORA18C, MEGABYTES 50

      RMTTRAIL added.


- Check if the Extract and Pump processes have been added with "info all" as below :         

      GGSCI (OGG181DB183) 11> info all

      Program     Status      Group       Lag at Chkpt  Time Since Chkpt

      MANAGER     RUNNING                                           
      EXTRACT     STOPPED     E_MYSQL     00:00:00      00:02:57    
      EXTRACT     STOPPED     P_ORA18C    00:00:00      00:02:55    



### **STEP 3**: Setup Microservices Target 

We will use the web UI for the Administration Service of the SanFran Deployment (http://hostname:17001).

- Open a new browser tab and connect to http://hostname:17001 

- Login with the following oggadmin/Welcome1

- On the Overview page click the plus sign (+) opposite the Replicat status.

![](images/9100/Lab700_image103.png)

- On the next page click “Next” to create an Nonintegrated Replicat.

![](images/9100/Lab700_image104.png)

- Fill in the required parameters (See Screenshot).  Then click “Next”.

![](images/9100/Lab700_image105.png)

- The next page will show the parameter file.  Delete the "Map*.*, TARGET *.*;" statement and add the following "MAP amea.*, TARGET OGGMSALAB**X**.*;". Where **X** is equal to you partcipant id which as assigned to you.
          
                -- MAP *.*, TARGET *.*;
                MAP amea.*, TARGET OGGMSALAB**X**.*;
- Click **“Create”**.
![](images/9100/Lab700_image106.png)

![](images/9100/Lab700_image107.png)

- The delivery process is created. Now click on the Action drop down and select "Start".
![](images/9100/Lab700_image1071.png)

- The replicat will be running , It might fail if you have not started the Pump process on the MySQL side

![](images/9100/Lab700_image1072.png)

### **STEP 4**: Loading Data and validating the setup

- If not already done, Open a new Terminal window from the VNC Console.

- Sudo into the root user and when Prompted use the password 'Welcome1'

      [oracle@OGG181DB183 ~]$ sudo su - root
      [sudo] password for oracle: 
      Last login: Thu Feb 14 18:10:24 UTC 2019 on pts/1
      Last failed login: Thu Feb 14 18:12:02 UTC 2019 from 73.163.148.213 on ssh:notty
      There were 6 failed login attempts since the last successful login. 
      
- Change to the MySQL GG home.
      
      [root@OGG181DB183 ~]# cd /opt/app/oracle/product/18.1.0_GGMySQL
    
- Run the GoldenGate command interpreter (GGSCI).
