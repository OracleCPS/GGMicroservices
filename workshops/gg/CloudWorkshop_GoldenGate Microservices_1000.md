## Working with REST API
## Introduction

In this lab, you will take a look at how to pull a list of services from Oracle GoldenGate using the REST APIs. Replace <port> with the port number of the service you want to access.

Steps:
1. Open a command window (right mouse click â€“ Open Terminal)

2. Try running the following CURL command.
curl -u oggadmin:welcome1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept:
application/json" -X GET
http://localhost:<port>/services/v2/deployments/SanFran_1/services/distsrvr/logs |
python -mjson.tool

3. Retrieve Log locations using the following CURL command
curl -u oggadmin:welcome1 -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H
"Accept:application/json" -X GET http://localhost:<port>/services/v2/logs | python - mjson.tool

At this point you should see activity on the table by looking at the Extract/Replicats.
Correct any problems that may arise due.

At this point, you should have a fully functional REST Api environment.
