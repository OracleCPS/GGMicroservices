        "description": "These labs will give you a basic understanding of the Oracle Database Cloud Service and many of the capabilities around administration and database development.  The labs will walk you through creating and accessing a new Database Cloud Service instance.  You will explore some common use cases for moving your data from on-premises to the cloud.  Next, you will use the Oracle Database Cloud Backup Module and RMAN to backup your on-premise data to the Oracle Public Cloud and then recover lost data.  Lastly, you will deploy an APEX application and adjust the firewall rules to support access to the application from the Internet using your browser, smart phone or tablet.",
